description       Fastest. Messaging. Ever.
long_description  ØMQ looks like an embeddable networking library but acts \
                  like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that \
                  carry whole messages across various transports like \
                  inproc, IPC, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets \
                  N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pubsub, task \
                  distribution, and request-reply. It's fast and small \
                  enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its \
                  asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore \
                  applications, built as asynchronous message-processing \
                  tasks. It has over twenty language APIs and runs on most \
                  operating systems. ØMQ is open source and fully supported \
                  by iMatix.
